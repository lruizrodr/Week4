// 1. Console log all numbers 
// a.) from 0 to 9 (inclusive).
// b.) from 1 to 10 (inclusive).
// c.) from 9 to 0 (inclusive).
// d.) from 10 to 1 (inclusive).
// e.) that are even between 1 and 25. Instead of the odd numbers, write "odd".

// 2. Ask the user to enter an integer between 1 and 100. Validate your input and
// repeat asking the user for this input until the user succeeds.

// 3. Extend exercise 2. Create an algorithm that guesses the 
// number entered by the user optimally such that we always exclude at least 
// half of the available numbers in the domain 1 to 100. 
// In each step, console log the guess and console log whether the number to be 
// guessed is lower, higher, or equal to the guess.
// Example: suppose the user entered 35. The computer's guesses: 
// 50 lower (remaining interval: 1 to 49)
// 25 higher (remaining interval: 26 to 49)
// 38 lower (remaining interval: 26 to 38)
// 31 higher (remaining interval: 32 to 38)
// 35 match

// 4. Think of a number between 1 and 100, but don't tell this to the computer.
// Once the computer guesses a number based on the rules seen in exercise 3,
// tell the computer if your number is greater than, less than, or equal to the
// guess of the computer. The computer continues guessing until it guesses your
// number correctly.
